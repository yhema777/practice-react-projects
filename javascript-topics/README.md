# Call
 - With call method you can write a method that can be used on different objects
 - We have to pass any arguments in seperately, beside the object
 - Using call, function is immediately invoked
 - Syntax: obj1.functionName().call(obj2)
 - Syntax: obj1.functionName().call(obj2,"arg1", "arg2")

# Apply
 - It is also similar to call, but it accepts arguments in the array
 - Syntax: obj1.functionName().apply(obj2)
 - Syntax: obj1.functionName().apply(obj2,[arg1, arg2])

# Bind
 - It is also similar to call but it returns other function which can be called later
